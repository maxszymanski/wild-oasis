# Wild Oasis

!!! No mobile version !!!

This is a hotel management application developed during a course by [@Jonas Schmedtmann](https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann).
The application allows users to manage hotel check-ins and check-outs, bookings, add breakfasts, change room prices, and view hotel occupancy statistics and earnings. 
This project was created for learning purposes, and I have added a few of my own features and lines of code.
